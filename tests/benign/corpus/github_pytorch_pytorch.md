--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:
- Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
- Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system

You can reuse your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed.

## More About PyTorch

[Learn the basics of PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)

At a granular level, PyTorch is a library that consists of the following components:

| Component | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| [**torch**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html) | A Tensor library like NumPy, with strong GPU support |
| [**torch.autograd**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html) | A tape-based automatic differentiation library that supports all differentiable Tensor operations in torch |
| [**torch.jit**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) | A compilation stack (TorchScript) to create serializable and optimizable models from PyTorch code  |
| [**torch.nn**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) | A neural networks library deeply integrated with autograd designed for maximum flexibility |
